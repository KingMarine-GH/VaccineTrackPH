## Info

This website uses [OurWorldInData's vaccine information on the
Philippines] ([link](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=PHL)).
The Philippine Statistics Authority's 2020 census data is used
for the Philippine population. All data before August 12, 2021
about vaccine deliveries are taken from hacktibista's HerdImmunityPH
([Twitter](https://twitter.com/HerdImmunityPH) [Website](herdimmunity.ph)).
All data beyond August 12 is added manually. A link to an article will be
tweeted automatically when vaccine supply is updated.

Data is stored in Google's Firebase Firstore service.
